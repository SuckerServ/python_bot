=== Adding Servers ===

Checkout config.py for that

'server1': {                          <- name of the server
    'host':          'localhost',     <- host of the server
    'port':           28795,          <- irc listener port (gameport + 10)
    'password':       '',             <- irc listener password (defined in the server.conf of hopmod)
    'format':         '\00301%s\003', <- color for the server name
    'reconnect_time': 60,             <- reconnect time in seconds, if the server was disconnect or restarted
},

* Warning: Don't copy that example to the config without removing the comments! *
